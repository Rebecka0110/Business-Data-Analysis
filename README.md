# Business Analyst Portfolio
Hi everyone! My name is Rebecka.
I've always enjoyed guiding and helping people into the right direction to constantly improve themselves. In addition with my love of analyzing new information or issues through data, communication and observations and my passion in business, I believe that a Business Analyst role is the right job for me.  
This repository is my portofolio showcasing technical and non-technical skills to become a Business Analyst.
